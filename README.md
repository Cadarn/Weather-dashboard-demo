# Weather Dashboard Concept

This is a demonstration of the sort of thing that could be incorporated into a weather deashboard using API and archived data from OpenWeatherMap and the UK Met Office respecively.

The main page is index.html: 
* It uses the Keen.io Bootstrap dashboard template.
* Uses interactive plots hosted by plot.ly 
* Loads an OpenLayers.js map with weather overlays loaded from the owm-dev.html
